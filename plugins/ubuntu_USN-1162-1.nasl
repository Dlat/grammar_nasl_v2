did not correctly initialize memory. A remote attacker could send
specially crafted traffic to read kernel stack memory, leading to a
loss of privacy. (CVE-2011-1173)

check certain field sizes. If a system was using IRDA, a remote
attacker could send specially crafted traffic to crash the system or
gain root privileges. (CVE-2011-1180)

Julien Tinnes discovered that the kernel did not correctly validate
the signal structure from tkill(). A local attacker could exploit this
to send signals to arbitrary threads, possibly bypassing expected
restrictions. (CVE-2011-1182)
