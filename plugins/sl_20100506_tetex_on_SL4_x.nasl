"A buffer overflow flaw was found in the way teTeX processed virtual
font files when converting DVI files into PostScript. An attacker
could create a malicious DVI file that would cause the dvips
executable to crash or, potentially, execute arbitrary code.
(CVE-2010-0827)

Multiple integer overflow flaws were found in the way teTeX processed
special commands when converting DVI files into PostScript. An
attacker could create a malicious DVI file that would cause the dvips
executable to crash or, potentially, execute arbitrary code.
(CVE-2010-0739, CVE-2010-1440)

A stack-based buffer overflow flaw was found in the way teTeX
processed DVI files containing HyperTeX references with long titles,
when converting them into PostScript. An attacker could create a
malicious DVI file that would cause the dvips executable to crash.
(CVE-2007-5935)

teTeX embeds a copy of Xpdf, an open source Portable Document Format
(PDF) file viewer, to allow adding images in PDF format to the
generated PDF documents. The following issues affect Xpdf code :

Multiple integer overflow flaws were found in Xpdf's JBIG2 decoder. If
a local user generated a PDF file from a TeX document, referencing a
specially crafted PDF file, it would cause Xpdf to crash or,
potentially, execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user
running pdflatex. (CVE-2009-0147, CVE-2009-1179)

Multiple integer overflow flaws were found in Xpdf. If a local user
generated a PDF file from a TeX document, referencing a specially
crafted PDF file, it would cause Xpdf to crash or, potentially,
execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user running
pdflatex. (CVE-2009-0791, CVE-2009-3609)

A heap-based buffer overflow flaw was found in Xpdf's JBIG2 decoder.
If a local user generated a PDF file from a TeX document, referencing
a specially crafted PDF file, it would cause Xpdf to crash or,
potentially, execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user
running pdflatex. (CVE-2009-0195)

Multiple buffer overflow flaws were found in Xpdf's JBIG2 decoder. If
a local user generated a PDF file from a TeX document, referencing a
specially crafted PDF file, it would cause Xpdf to crash or,
potentially, execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user
running pdflatex. (CVE-2009-0146, CVE-2009-1182)

Multiple flaws were found in Xpdf's JBIG2 decoder that could lead to
the freeing of arbitrary memory. If a local user generated a PDF file
from a TeX document, referencing a specially crafted PDF file, it
would cause Xpdf to crash or, potentially, execute arbitrary code with
the privileges of the user running pdflatex. (CVE-2009-0166,
CVE-2009-1180)

Multiple input validation flaws were found in Xpdf's JBIG2 decoder. If
a local user generated a PDF file from a TeX document, referencing a
specially crafted PDF file, it would cause Xpdf to crash or,
potentially, execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user
running pdflatex. (CVE-2009-0800)

Multiple denial of service flaws were found in Xpdf's JBIG2 decoder.
If a local user generated a PDF file from a TeX document, referencing
a specially crafted PDF file, it would cause Xpdf to crash.
