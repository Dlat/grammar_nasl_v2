"Vasiliy Kulikov discovered that kvm did not correctly clear memory. A
local attacker could exploit this to read portions of the kernel
stack, leading to a loss of privacy. (CVE-2010-3881)

Timo Warns discovered that the LDM disk partition handling code did
not correctly handle certain values. By inserting a specially crafted
disk device, a local attacker could exploit this to gain root
privileges. (CVE-2011-1017)

Neil Horman discovered that NFSv4 did not correctly handle certain
orders of operation with ACL data. A remote attacker with access to an
NFSv4 mount could exploit this to crash the system, leading to a
denial of service. (CVE-2011-1090)

Timo Warns discovered that OSF partition parsing routines did not
correctly clear memory. A local attacker with physical access could
plug in a specially crafted block device to read kernel memory,
leading to a loss of privacy. (CVE-2011-1163)

Dan Rosenberg discovered that MPT devices did not correctly validate
certain values in ioctl calls. If these drivers were loaded, a local
attacker could exploit this to read arbitrary kernel memory, leading
to a loss of privacy. (CVE-2011-1494, CVE-2011-1495)

Tavis Ormandy discovered that the pidmap function did not correctly
handle large requests. A local attacker could exploit this to crash
the system, leading to a denial of service. (CVE-2011-1593)

Oliver Hartkopp and Dave Jones discovered that the CAN network driver
did not correctly validate certain socket structures. If this driver
was loaded, a local attacker could crash the system, leading to a
denial of service. (CVE-2011-1598, CVE-2011-1748)

Vasiliy Kulikov discovered that the AGP driver did not check certain
ioctl values. A local attacker with access to the video subsystem
could exploit this to crash the system, leading to a denial of
service, or possibly gain root privileges. (CVE-2011-1745,
CVE-2011-2022)

Vasiliy Kulikov discovered that the AGP driver did not check the size
of certain memory allocations. A local attacker with access to the
video subsystem could exploit this to run the system out of memory,
leading to a denial of service. (CVE-2011-1746)

Dan Rosenberg reported an error in the old ABI compatibility layer of
ARM kernels. A local attacker could exploit this flaw to cause a
denial of service or gain root privileges. (CVE-2011-1759)

Dan Rosenberg discovered that the DCCP stack did not correctly handle
certain packet structures. A remote attacker could exploit this to
crash the system, leading to a denial of service. (CVE-2011-1770)

Timo Warns discovered that the EFI GUID partition table was not
correctly parsed. A physically local attacker that could insert
mountable devices could exploit this to crash the system or possibly
gain root privileges. (CVE-2011-1776)

Yogesh Sharma discovered that CIFS did not correctly handle UNCs that
had no prefixpaths. A local attacker with access to a CIFS partition
could exploit this to crash the system, leading to a denial of
service. (CVE-2011-3363).
